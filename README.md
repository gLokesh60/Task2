# Task2
This project presents an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The objective is to understand the structure and key characteristics of the data through statistical summaries and visual visualizations. The analysis involves cleaning the dataset by handling missing values and encoding categorical features, followed by generating descriptive statistics like mean, median, and standard deviation. Visual tools such as histograms, boxplots, heatmaps, pairplots, and countplots are used to explore the relationships between features like age, gender, passenger class, fare, and survival. Key insights reveal that females and first-class passengers had higher survival rates, and passengers who paid higher fares were more likely to survive. This EDA lays the groundwork for further modeling and helps identify important patterns and anomalies in the data.
